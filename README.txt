To run this program:
For Windows: Double-click the Comand Script called "Run Me.cmd" in the "target" folder	
For MacOS: Run "mainProgram.jar" in the command terminal.


NOTES:
***Make sure your terminal is set up to run .jar files.***

***If you are running this and keep getting "waiting for API servers..." on the first run, this is due to a request 
limit from the API server, and if it is happening right away then someone else is using it at the same time. Consider getting 
your own key at https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key and changing the key in the Quotes.java file and recompiling 
using Apache Maven.***
